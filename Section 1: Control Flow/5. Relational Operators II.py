# Relational Operators 2
# We know about "==" and "1=" so now here is four more

# ">" greater than
# ">=" greater than or equal to
# "<" less than
# "<=" less than or equal to

#Example
#Sam needs a 70 to pass. He got a 60. Did he pass?
samgrade = 60
pass_grade = 70

if samgrade >= pass_grade:
    print("You passed! Gj mate.")
elif samgrade < pass_grade:
    print("You failed! Better Luck next time mate.")
print('')
print("Essentially these operators can be used to create if elif statements")
print('At least from I can gather (>_<)')
