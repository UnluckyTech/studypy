# Modifying 2D Lists
# Similar to how you access 2D lists.
# Now you redefine whatever is being accessed.
# Example
incoming_class = [['Kenny', 'American', 9], ['Tanya', 'Russian', 9], ['Madison', 'Indian', 7]]
print(incoming_class)
incoming_class[2][2] = 8
print(incoming_class)
incoming_class[-3][-3] = 'Ken'
print(incoming_class)
