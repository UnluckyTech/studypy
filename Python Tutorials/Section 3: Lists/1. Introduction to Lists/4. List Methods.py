# List Methods
# In Python, for any specific data-type there is built-in functionality
# that we can use to create, manipulate, and delete data.
# An example would be the method .append() which allows us to add an element
# to the end of a list.
# Example
append_example = [ 'This', 'is', 'an', 'example']
append_example.append('list')
 
print(append_example)
