# Summary
# I am just goihng to summarize each section into one script.
# Just because there is little info going on in each one.

# 1. Comments
# Comments are made by using the # at the beginning of the line or comment.

# 2. Print
# You can print onto the console by typing print.
# Example
print('Hello World!')

# 3. Strings
# Strings are a sentence in quotes '', "".
#Example
china = 'Dank country yaes'
print(china)
print('strings can be written in print or used to define variables.')

# 4. Variables
# Speaking of variables
# Example
dis_is_variable = "Something"
numbvariable = 2

# 5. Modulo
# Skipped a couple things but its alot of basics you know already.
# Modulo operator is indicated by % and gives the remainder of a division calculation.
# This is something I didnt learn before.
# Example
print(29%5) # Remainder is 4 so answer is 4

# 6. Concatenation
# Simply allows you to put together several strings
# Example
string1 = "The wind, "
string2 = "which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity, "
string3 = "sank at sunset to a light breeze; "
string4 = "the soft air just ruffled the water and "
string5 = "caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the shore, "
string6 = "from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and hay."

# Define message below:
message = string1 + string2 + string3 + string4 + string5 + string6

#print(message)
print(message)

# 7. Plus Equals
# This allows you to add onto currently defined variables.
# Instead of overwriting them.
# Example
miles_hiked = 12
print(miles_hiked) #12
miles_hiked += 5
print(miles_hiked) #17

# 8 Multi-line Strings
# Lastly is by using three quote-marks (""" or ''') instead of one, 
# enables for use of multiple lines until """ is presented again.

# Example 
to_you = """Stranger, if you passing meet me and desire to speak to me, why
  should you not speak to me?
And why should I not speak to you?"""


print(to_you)
